<h1 align="center">welcome to the-archives</h1>

This repo contains all kinds of projects I coded or started to code over the years.
Some originate from School, some are things I did because I wanted to.

So basically its a place where all kinds of projects slumber that have been retired.

## meet the manager

Because just a repo with 3 folders would be a bit boring I created the manager.
Its a website documenting all projects that have been archived. Some contain more infos some less.

### how to start the manager

You will need yarn installed.

```bash
# install all deps
cd ./manager && yarn

# start the manager on port 3000
yarn start
```

for more commands run `cd /manager` and there u have more commands available. To see them all checkout `manager/package.json`.

## the three categories

I thought about just dumping all repos into one repo and thats it, but I decided against it.  
Mainly because I can currently easily categorize all projects into three categories.

- School
- Websites
- Other

### School

I am currently doing my apprenticeship @ Swisscom, which means I need to attend a vocational school where we have computer science Modules. In each of those Modules we either have to code things or we look at some working techniques or other administrative themed things.

So thats where all of those projects originate from.

### Websites

Even before my apprenticeship I started coding. I started with HTML, JavaScript and CSS and later on a bit of Python. But I mainly sticked to HTML, JavaScript and CSS because I wanted to develop Apps which I couldn't, because I didn't own a MacBook which you "need" to develop iOS Apps. And the web was a good alternative, its accessible form basically everywhere and you only need to develop it once and at that its pretty simple.

So over the years I created a lot of webapps and thats where all those websites are from.

### Other

Besides my large amount of websites I did created some discord bots and lately I started to learn a bit of rust, which after all those webdev days feels a bit refreshing.

Thats what is in that category for now.
