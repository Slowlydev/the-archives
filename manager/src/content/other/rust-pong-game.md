## About

A small pond game I did with the Rust game engine called bevy. It only has the base hit-boxes nothing more.

## Why?

I originally did this project to learn a bit of rust and bevy, because I really wanna do something else than
creating websites with highlevel languages. Because after 4 Years of hobby & work webdev it gets a bit boring.

I choose rust because it seems simple and its lowlevel and it seems to be the new flashy thing.
Sadly I didn't really get to do anything else in rust and bevy manily because I had to big project ideas and
I didn't really know how to start.

## Other Projects

After the pong game, I did a bevy shader pixelation example which u can find here:
