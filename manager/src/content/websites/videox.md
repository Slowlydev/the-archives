When iOS 14 relased Picture-in-Picture, but Youtube didn't support it. I had the idea to create a shortcut which opens a Youtube video on the website VideoX and then returns to the homescreen, which puts the youtube Video in Picture-in-Picture. Sadly after a few months this got patched from Youtube.
