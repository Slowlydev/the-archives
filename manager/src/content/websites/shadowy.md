## About

My 9th grade semester project. Its a 2D Platformer game, where its all about speed.

U can create an account, select a character, and play 3 Different levels and compete for the fastest times on a real-time Leaderboard.

Back then I had never done such thing before, like a game.

I also didn't write a lot of the game code, I mostly followed a tutorial how to do a platformer game with a Tilemap and hitboxes in Pixi.js.

It was a fun experience back then, they also had me write a documentation about it as well as an PowerPoint presentation. It utlizes Firebase as a backend which made my life a lot easier, as well as the realtime part of the Leaderboard was basically "built-in".

## Technologies

The frontend was written with Next.js and firebase as well as Pixi.js for the game part.
