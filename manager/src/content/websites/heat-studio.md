## Intro

I always wanted to create Apps on my iPhone but never had a mac, so I searched for alternative ways to create apps on iPhones. I stubled opon React Native and later opon Ionic. A UI Libary that has components that look like Swift UI or Material UI elements.

## The WebApp

The WebApp was about "Need for Speed: Heat" back then the newest Neef for Speed game. I played it a lot and I wanted to make an app about it. I added 4 pages, there is a "home feed", a list of all cars and their stats (it took ages to index all cars by HAND), and a map in night and day time.

## the current state

Over the time the app got buggier and buggier and now is almost un usable. But it was my first contact with React, without even realising I was using it
