## Why and the goal?

The goal of the Module we did this project in was to use 3-4 AWS services and write a project that utilized most of them.
Our idea was a simple youtube clone, just a video platform basically, the ui is our own.

## AWS Services

The AWS services we used are:

- S3
- Database
- Frontend hosting
- EC2

## The End

Sadly our student accounts didn’t support some ISM system so we couldn’t get all services to work together.
