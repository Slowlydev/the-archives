  - nest.js
  - typeorm
  - Next.js

Mainly it was just about using typeorm to create DB Schemas and realtions, as well as entites.
But I had the great Idea to create a whole game but, as this aswell was a thing for a school Module I stoped developing it till the end.
So its just a bit of a corpse of a project now.
Backend is written in nest.js and typeorm. The frontend is next.js
