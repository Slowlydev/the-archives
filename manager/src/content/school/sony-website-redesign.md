## The original use case

We had to create a website that featured mutliple ages with desktop and mobile navigation, aswell as galeries and carusels.
That was for a webdev module we had.

So I decided to create a small redesign of the sony website, manily featureing example iamges and product pages.

## The other useages

Later we had a docker & kubernetes module. So I decided to take this project and first dockerize it and later then
create a kubernetes config file for it.
