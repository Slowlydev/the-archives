## What?

A VERY small html page with some buttons and animations which we had do deploy on a simple apatche webserver.

## A fun fact!

A small fun fact is that I acctually used scss and used a VSCode extension to generate a css file, because I find scss easier sometimes,
especially when doing hover effects on html elements.
